            2. [possibility]: Compare the targetWeight of goalData with weeklyWeight and evaluate the possibility of reaching the targetWeight when looking at progressionRate up to the endDate.
            3. [evaluates]: Analyze the relationship between burnedCalories and calories to evaluate the user's eating and exercise habits. Specify any concerning patterns.
            4. [tips]: Provide 3 actionable tips that will be beneficial for the userâ€™s situation in achieving their goals.
            5. [cheering]: Write an encouraging message to motivate the user to consistently manage their progress and reach their target weight by the endDate.
